Have you ever imagined stretching a simple idea into an enormous, constantly evolving challenge through skillful AI implementation? If you have, sorry... we did it first!

We've taken the core concept of a classic game — Battleship — and evolved it into a cutting-edge digital experience, implementing elements of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Learning (ML) to create a deeply personal (and dystopian?) gaming experience. 

Core Concept: Two Paths to Victory
The core idea is simple: You compete against an evolving LLM opponent. Both you and the AI hide your Heart somewhere on a grid with a uniquely generated and visually stunning background. Your objective is to find the AI's Heart, while the AI's sole objective is to deceive and trick you into guessing the wrong location. So watch out! Because if you guess wrong, you lose everything. 

Yet, remember. You shape the path to victory. Do you choose Dialog, or Combat?

1. THE DUEL OF MINDS
   What it is? Dialogue under intense time pressure.
