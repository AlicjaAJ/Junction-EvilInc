# Junction-EvilInc: AI-Powered Strategy Game
>>>>>>> 578e5e9 (update readme)

A turn-based strategy game where you compete against an LLM-powered AI opponent in a dystopian future. Each playthrough features dynamically generated narratives, strategic gameplay, and an AI opponent with distinct personalities.

## Overview

This project combines classic grid-based strategy gameplay with modern AI capabilities. You and an AI opponent each hide an item on a grid, then race to find each other's item first. The game features:

- **Dynamic Story Generation**: Each game begins with a unique, LLM-generated mission briefing set in a dystopian AI vs Humanity conflict
- **AI Opponent with Personalities**: Face an opponent that can be honest, deceptive, or unpredictable
- **Interactive Chat System**: Exchange hints and engage in dialogue with your AI opponent
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose from Easy (5x5), Medium (10x10), or Hard (15x15) grids
- **Time-Limited Gameplay**: Race against the clock with limited attempts to find your target
- **Outcome-Based Endings**: Each game concludes with a dynamically generated story based on your victory or defeat

## Features

### Dynamic Narratives
Every game session starts with a unique mission briefing generated by Google's Gemini LLM. The story sets the scene for your mission, introducing the items you must protect and locate. The narrative adapts to the game's outcome, providing a personalized conclusion.

### AI Opponent System
The AI opponent features three distinct personalities:
- **Honest**: Always tells the truth when asked about its item's location
- **Deceptive**: Strategically lies to mislead you
- **50-50**: Unpredictably switches between truth and deception

### Strategic Gameplay
- Hide your item (beacon) on the grid
- Search for the AI's item (artifact) within a time limit
- Use limited attempts wisely
- Engage with the AI through chat to gather information (or misinformation)
- Make strategic decisions based on the AI's personality and responses

### Cyberpunk Aesthetic
The game features a retro-futuristic cyberpunk visual style with:
- CRT scanline effects
- Neon cyan color scheme
- Terminal-style UI elements
- Dynamic image generation for mission briefings and outcomes

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 to 3.13
- Google Gemini API key (from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)) or Google Cloud Vertex AI credentials

**To get your API key:**
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Click "Get API key"
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy and paste it into your `.env` file

#### Option B: Google Cloud Vertex AI

Edit `.env` and add:

```env
USE_VERTEX_AI=true
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp
```

**Setup steps:**
1. Ensure you have a Google Cloud project with Vertex AI API enabled
2. Authenticate: `gcloud auth application-default login`
3. Add your project ID to `.env`

The demo provides a focused look at the following features of the game:
- On loop experience from an exemplary level, with possibility of choosing the difficulty and compeete with three of our models: the one which always Lies/ always Tells the Truths/ does 50:50.
- Psychological Dialogue: Engage in the core mechanic where your dialogue is constantly scored by the ML system to create tailored LLM models which constantly try to trick you into loosing.
- Stunning visuals, based on 90s games.
- Unique stories which make every round unique.

## Running the Game

```bash
# Activate virtual environment if not already active
source venv/bin/activate     # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows

# Run the game
python3 main.py  # or: python main.py
```

## Game Flow

1. **Mission Briefing**: A dynamically generated story sets up your mission
2. **Difficulty Selection**: Choose Easy (5x5), Medium (10x10), or Hard (15x15)
3. **Item Placement**: Hide your beacon on the grid
4. **Chat Phase**: Optionally exchange hints with the AI opponent
5. **Turn-Based Gameplay**: 
   - Click cells to reveal them
   - Find the AI's artifact before it finds your beacon
   - Manage your time and attempts carefully
6. **Mission Outcome**: A dynamically generated ending story concludes your mission

## Game Mechanics

### Difficulty Levels

| Difficulty | Grid Size | Time Limit | Max Attempts |
|------------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Easy       | 5x5       | 30 seconds | 5 attempts   |
| Medium     | 10x10     | 40 seconds | 4 attempts   |
| Hard       | 15x15     | 50 seconds | 3 attempts   |

### Victory Conditions

- **You Win**: Find the AI's artifact before time runs out or attempts are exhausted
- **AI Wins**: Time expires, attempts are exhausted, or the AI finds your beacon first

### Chat System

Click the chat input box to interact with the AI opponent. You can:
- Ask about the AI's item location (responses depend on personality)
- Request strategic hints
- Engage in character-appropriate dialogue

The AI maintains context from the mission briefing and adapts its responses based on its personality.

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **Pygame**: Game engine and rendering
- **Google Gemini API**: LLM for story generation and AI opponent
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Image processing
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

### API Models

The game uses Google's Gemini models with automatic fallback:
- Primary: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`
- Fallback: `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` or `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`

### Architecture

- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for story generation, AI opponent, and game logic
- **Threading**: Background story and image generation to prevent UI blocking
- **State Management**: Clear game state transitions for smooth gameplay
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

- Ensure your `.env` file exists in the project root
- Verify the API key has no extra spaces or quotes
- Check your API quota at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
- For Vertex AI, ensure authentication is set up: `gcloud auth application-default login`

### Import Errors

```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Story Generation Fails

- Check your internet connection
- Verify API key is valid and has available quota
- The game will use a fallback story if generation fails

### Image Generation Issues

- Image generation is optional; the game works without it
- If image generation fails, placeholder graphics are displayed
- Ensure you have the `requests` library installed for image generation

## Development

### Code Style

- Follows Python PEP 8 conventions
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Uses double quotes for strings
- DRY principles applied throughout
